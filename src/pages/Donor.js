                <h4>
                My name is Andrew Gagliostro and over the past few months I have been building a social enterprise called ShareMore. 
                ShareMore’s goal is to connect fans with the people they adore to benefit worthy causes worldwide. 
                </h4>

                <h4>
                A social enterprise is a business that strives to efficiently and responsibly maximize profits 
                with the goal of maximizing benefits to society and the environment.
                </h4>

    
                <h4>
                ShareMore is a raffle-based fundraising platform where we ask celebrities and public figures to donate anything you may have laying around that a fan may like to get their hands on. 
                It’s up to you to choose where the funds from ticket sales go: keep some if you’d like, and choose charity or organization to recieve the rest on your behalf!
                </h4>

                <h4>
                I urge you to ask "Why Sharemore when I could just sell this on my own?" We understand that you already have ways to give back and
                an audience of loving fans that you've developed through your personality and hard work.
                </h4>

                <h4> 
                A no-cost sale of anything you choose to donate is just one part of how we plan to generate funds for your causes. What we are offering is an opportunity to 
                join a <b>movement where we not only fundraise through sales, but also through leveraging different forms of advertisements and brand deals</b>. 

                There are countless tech platforms that generate billions of dollars in revenue each year through digital advertising efforts: in most for-profit organizations,
                these funds go towards benefitting the organization and its stakeholders. At ShareMore, we are trying to change the game: <b>generating ad revenue from 
                socially responsible organizations and redistributing profits to help the causes you choose. </b>

                </h4>


                <h4>

                That means that aside from the funds generated from your auction or raffle, we will also be able to help the world through
                each person who clicks on that link. We ask you to buy into our movement because with each celebrity that joins, we have more 
                opportunity and merit to generate funds and build internal efforts to give back.

                </h4>


                <h4>
                In the world we live in, fandom merchandise is usually in the hands of someone who has disposable income 
                or is lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.
                ShareMore’s goal is to transform the fandom industry to one that, rather than supporting those with money and luck, maximizes raffle accessibility (and in turn profit) 
                while redistributing funds to those who need it most.
                </h4>
                

                <h4>
                Any way you can help would be greatly appreciated. We are not looking to "sell" anyone on our idea: we're
                looking for partners who believe in our mission and share our desire to be a part of something that can make the world a better place.
                I would love to speak further about any questions you may have: feel free to call @(+1) 973-830-7793 or email @argagliostro@gmail.com.
