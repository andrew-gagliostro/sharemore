                <h4>
                My name is Andrew Gagliostro and over the past few months I have been building a nonprofit called ShareMore. 
                ShareMore’s goal is to connect fans with the people they adore to benefit worthy causes worldwide. 
                </h4>

    
                <h4>
                ShareMore is a marketplace where we ask celebrities and public figures to donate anything you may have laying around that a fan may like to get their hands on! 
                It’s up to you to choose where the profit goes: keep some if you’d like, and choose charity or organization to recieve the rest on your behalf!
                We take no profit at all.
                </h4>

                <h4>
                I urge you to ask "Why Sharemore when I could just sell this on my own?" We understand that you already have ways to give back and
                an audience of loving fans that you've developed through your personality and hard work.
                </h4>

                <h4> 
                A no-cost sale of anything you choose to donate is just small part of how we plan to generate funds for your causes. What we are offering is an opportunity to 
                join a movement where we not only generate funds from sales, but also through leveraging different forms of advertisements and brand deals. For-profit organizations 
                do this to generate millions in value for their stakeholders, but we plan to generate millions for the people and causes that really need it.
                That means that aside from the funds generated from your auction or raffle, we will also be able to help the world through
                each person who clicks on that link. We ask you to buy into our movement because with each celebrity that joins we have more 
                opportunity and merit to generate funds through other streams and build internal efforts to give back.
                </h4>


                <h4>
                In the world we live in, fandom merchandise is usually in the hands of someone who has disposable income 
                or is lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.
                ShareMore’s goal is to transform the fandom industry to one that, rather than supporting privilidge and luck, maximizes raffle accessibility and auction exposure (and in turn profit) 
                while redistributing all funds to those who need it most.
                </h4>
                

                <h4>
                Any way you can help would be greatly appreciated. We are not looking to "sell" anyone on our idea: we're
                looking for partners who believe in our mission and share our desire to be a part of something that can make the world a better place.
                I would love to speak further about any questions you may have: feel free to call @(+1) 973-830-7793 or email @argagliostro@gmail.com.
